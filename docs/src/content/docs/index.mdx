<Steps>

	1. Install the reflection:

		```bash
		composer require good-php/reflection
		```

	2. Build a reflector:

		```php
		use GoodPhp\Reflection\ReflectorBuilder;

		$reflector = new ReflectorBuilder()
			->withFileCache()
			->withMemoryCache()
			->build();
		```

		:::caution
		Building the reflector is expensive. Make sure you only build it once per process lifetime :)

</Steps>

## Customizing cache

It's crucial that you use some kind of cache. Out of the box, we support file-based cache and in-memory cache.
They work together - file cache allows faster startup times, while in-memory cache allows accessing the
same reflections repeatedly during the PHP process lifetime.

By default, `->withFileCache()` stores it's cache in `/tmp/good-php-reflection` without any expiration. This
is configurable:

```php
new ReflectorBuilder()
	->withFileCache(
		path: '/other/directory',
		ttl: \DateInterval::createFromDateString('1 hour')
	);
```

There are also defaults for `->withMemoryCache()` - it stores at most 100 types, again without any expiration.
Configure it with:

```php
new ReflectorBuilder()
	->withMemoryCache(
		// 500 types metadata
		maxItems: 500,
		ttl: \DateInterval::createFromDateString('1 hour')
	);
```
