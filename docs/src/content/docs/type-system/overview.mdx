The type system is shipped within the library, but it's completely separate from reflection. It's designed to
be as simple as possible - you won't find complex inheritance trees like you would in PHPStan's type system.

All types implement a single interface - `Type`. It is "sealed" - meaning it's only meant to be implemented
by this library, and there is a limited set of inheritors, so it's safe to check for type using
`$type instanceof UnionType` kind of checks.
