## TupleType

```php
class TupleType implements Type
{
	/**
	 * @param list<Type> $types
	 */
	public function __construct(
		public array $types,
	) {}
}
```

Represents an array of types: `array{ string, int }`

## ExpandedType

```php
class ExpandedType implements Type
{
	public function __construct(
		public readonly Type $innerType
	) {}
}
```

Represents an expanded tuple type. Let's take `callable` and `\Closure` as an example:

```php
/**
 * @template TReturn
 * @template ...TParameter
 */
interface callable {}

/**
 * @template TReturn
 * @template ...TParameter
 *
 * @implements callable<TReturn, ...TParameter>
 */
class Closure implements callable {}
```

The above is more or less how `callable` and `\Closure` works in this library. Instead of having a separate type
for `callable` and it's subtypes, we chose to go another route: variadic type parameters. In this case,
the `TParameter` is variadic - meaning it accepts unlimited amount of parameters, the same way variadic function
parameter does. So `callable(string, int, float): bool` maps to `callable<bool, string, int, float>`, even
though there are only two type parameters - `TReturn` and `TParameter`.

:::note
`@template ...T` isn't a valid PHPDoc syntax - it's just for demonstration purposes :)

So what is `ExpandedType`? Well, that's exactly what `...TParameter` is in
`@implements callable<TReturn, ...TParameter>` - it expands the variadic `TParameter` type,
the same as you would when calling a function: `func(...$args)`
