title: Comparing Types
---

Sometimes you need to know if a `Collection<Cat>` is a subtype of `Collection<Animal>` - and for that
the `TypeComparator` exists. It's pretty rudimentary, but it should work. You can access it through
`->typeComparator()` on the reflector instance:

```php
$typeComparator = new ReflectorBuilder()
	->build()
	->typeComparator();

// true
$typeComparator->accepts(new NamedType(\Throwable::class), new NamedType(\Exception::class));
$typeComparator->accepts(MixedType::get(), new NamedType(\Exception::class));

// false
$typeComparator->accepts(new NamedType(\Generator::class), new NamedType(\Exception::class));

// true
$typeComparator->accepts(
	new UnionType([
		new NamedType(\Throwable::class),
		PrimitiveType::bool(),
	]),
	new NamedType(\Exception::class)
);
```

You get the point. You can feed it any types.
