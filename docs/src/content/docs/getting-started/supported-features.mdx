title: Supported Features
---

Most native reflection features and most PHPDoc (or, rather PHPStan) features are supported. Here's a full list:

- reflecting classes, interfaces, traits enums
- reflecting anonymous classes
- reflecting properties and methods
- `@template`, `@template-covariant`, `@template-contravariant`, upper bound (`of string`) and
default values (`= string`) - in classes and methods
- `@extends`, `@implements` and `@use`
- `@var` for properties and promoted properties
- `@param` for method parameters and promoted properties
- `@return` for method returns
- `@phpstan-` and `@psalm-` versions of all tags - with precedence
- all native types, template (generic) types and array tuples

## What isn't supported, but would be welcomed

- reflecting functions
- function/method return type inference from arguments
- conditional types
- type aliases (local and imported)
- some other PHPDoc tags
