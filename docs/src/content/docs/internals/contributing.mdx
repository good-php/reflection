<Steps>

	1. Please create an issue first. This way we can discuss it before you spend
		your time implementing it - it might not be feasible or might not align with the intended purpose
		of this library.

	2. Fork the repository.

	3. Clone it and install dependencies:

		```bash
		docker compose run -it --rm php composer i
		```

	4. Work on your feature/fix. Make sure to add tests that cover your work.

	5. Before committing, make sure you run the tests, PHPStan as well as code style fixer:

		```bash
		docker compose run -it --rm php composer test
		docker compose run -it --rm php composer phpstan
		docker compose run -it --rm php composer cs-fix
		```

	6. If it is a noticeable feature, don't forget to update the documentation in `docs/src/content`.
		You can preview your changes locally:

		```bash
		# Docs will be available at http://localhost:30050
		docker compose up -d
		```

	6. Commit, push and create a PR :)
